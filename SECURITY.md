# Security Policy

Security is very important for this project and its community. 🔒

Learn more about it below. 👇


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to: basaijapascal9@gmail.com. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

I (the author, [@Byabasaija](https://github.com/Byabasaija)) will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. 🙊

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
